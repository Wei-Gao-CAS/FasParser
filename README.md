# FasParser
A package for manipulating sequence data

A computer software package called FasParser has been developed for manipulating sequence files. It can be used on personal computers to perform a serious of analyses for sequence data, including count and view the differences of two sequences at both DNA and codon levels, identify the shared (overlapped) regions between two alignments, sort sequences according to their IDs or lengths, concatenate multiple loci sequences for a particular set of samples, translating DNA to protein, alignment construction and format conversion, and also some extraction and filtering analyses on a particular FASTA file. The majority of these functions can be used in a batch mode to analyze big data sets, and results obtained by this package would be much useful for other molecular analyses, like phylogeny reconstruction and positive selection detection. We hope our package will be helpful for a broad audience, especially for people who have no programming experience in sequence analyses.
