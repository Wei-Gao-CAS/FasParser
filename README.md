# FasParser
A package for manipulating sequence data

A computer software package called FasParser has been developed for manipulating sequence data. It can be used on personal computers to perform a series of analyses, including counting and viewing differences between two sequences at both DNA and codon levels, identify overlapping regions between two alignments, sort sequences according to their IDs or lengths, concatenate multiple loci sequences for a particular set of samples, translate DNA to protein, construct alignments with multiple different formats, and also some extraction and filtration analyses on a particular FASTA file. Majority of these functions can be run in a batch mode that is much useful for analyzing big data sets. We hope our package will be helpful for a broad audience, particularly those without programming experience in sequence analyses.
